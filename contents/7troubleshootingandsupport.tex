\section{Troubleshooting \& Support}

Throughout the design of this program, there may be bugs that might have been an oversight. Troubleshooting continues to become a problem and in the test that was conducted for user experience, the main error issue that exists is logging into the UMS.  These bugs may require troubleshooting to fix the error (e.g., spelling or capitalization for logging in). Although the program aims to support and be bug-free, they might remain in the program and if they are persistent and affecting the experience. Contact the authors of the program for assistance.
